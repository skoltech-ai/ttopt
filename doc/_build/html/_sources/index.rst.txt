The demo-scripts with detailed comments are collected in the folder `demo`:

- `base.py` - we find the minimum for the 10-dimensional function with vectorized input;

- `qtt.py` - we do almost the same as in the `base.py` script, but use the QTT-based approach (note that results are much more better then in the `base.py` example);

- `qtt_100d.py` - we do almost the same as in the `qtt.py` script, but approximate the 100-dimensional function;

- `vect.py` - we find the minimum for the simple analytic function with "simple input" (the function is not vectorized);

- `cache.py` - we find the minimum for the simple analytic function to demonstrate the usage of cache;

- `tensor.py` - in this example we find the minimum for the multidimensional array/tensor (i.e., discrete function).
